<p>The HTML format of the textbook takes advantage of the Sage programming language. Get acquainted with  [how this textbook uses Sage](https://books.aimath.org/aata/sets-sage.html) to learn more about it. Instructors can either assign this section to the students, or spend some time in class to illustrate how Sage works. The cells will take Python commands.</p>
<p>Each section of the HTML format of textbook contains Sage Exercises; they vary in complexity. The goal of these exercises is to get users to use technology to explore structures and make conjectures that would be very difficult to do by hand computation. For example, the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/cyclic-sage-exercises.html" target="_blank">Sage Exercises in Cyclic Groups</a> were written to help readers explore the cyclic patterns of the group of units mod \(n\text{,}\) \(U(n)\text{,}\) which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not. By using Sage, users can easily test whether or not the \(U(n)\) is cyclic for large values of \(n\) and then make a conjecture about what the general case should be.</p>
<p>Sage can be used by typing a command line in a terminal window, in a Sage worksheet, and in the Jupyter notebook; however, the most friendly way to learn Sage is to use the Sage cell server.  The Sage cell server allows Sage to be embedded in any web page.  Users can modify and execute the Sage code.  If the edited code results in disaster, one only needs to reload the web page to restore the original code.  See the <a class="url" href="http://utmost-sage-cell.org" target="_blank">Sage Cell Repository</a> for more information.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-textbook-specifics.html#li-7">in-context</a></span>
