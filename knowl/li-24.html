<p>The textbook makes heavy use of Sage cells (there are 96 vignettes with Sage cells, a list of which can be found here [Sage](https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-SL.html)). These are intended to help students learn to use Sage to do linear algebra and to learn how to do linear algebra by using computational examples. There is a separate GitHub repository, (Rbeezer/SLA) that contains 17 Sage worksheets that instructors can use in class (in several output formats, including Jupyter, PDF, etc.). ((((THIS TEXT NEEDS REVISION: They are "incomplete" it has a command that generates a random XXX. A carefully crafted example is available. there is a master document for each; they take between 5 and 20 minutes to run. Instructors can do them in class. they can see many different examples in class. In exams, the students can be asked to analyze 7x7 matrices; in a website they can cut and paste (reduce echelon form, factor,... eigenvalues.,,, determinant). the instructions in the exam indicates what operations they can use; they can use Sage to check their work. Students need to learn really well the syntax for entering the command during the exam.))))</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-textbook-specifics.html#li-24">in-context</a></span>
