<p>Each chapter of the HTML format of the textbook includes Reading Questions. Users of the PDF format of the textbook receive a PDF document with all the reading questions for each chapter of the textbook. These questions are included to encourage reading the textbook before class, as part of the preparation work. The UTMOST HTML format allows students to submit answers to these questions directly in the HTML version and have these responses saved and recorded. Once the students hit "submit answers", the instructor can immediately see the responses when logged in to their instructor account. The instructor version of the HTML textbook will show all the responses from the students who responded, each response labeled by the student ID, time, and date. Instructors might need to incentivize the completion of the reading questions by giving credit to students who complete them before class by certain time. The instructor can read the responses ahead of class and use them to tweak their plans for the day as needed. Some instructors show anonymized answers to address problems or to illustrate what an exemplary response looks like.</p>
