<p>This textbook does not use numbering system for the sections. The author uses acronyms to refer to each section, as they encode information about the content. The best way to handle them is to use them in class; students do not have to memorize them; only that they can recall what theorem they use. Every chapter has annotated acronyms for definitions and theorems that remind readers the importance of each of them. Although students get anxious about this, it is not such a big deal.</p>
